How to add images to the LevelEditor

1. Copy the images to /res/img/

2. Determine if a new entity is needed. 
	* In general you just need to determine if the new image will have properties/behaviors that are very 
		different from already existing Entites.
	* Re-skins of already existing Entities (ex. desertCliff) never need new Entities.

3. If needed, create the new Entity. Else skip to 4.

	3a. Right-click on the entities package and select new class.
	
	3b. Choose a name, then make the Superclass entities.Shape. Click 'include constructors from superclass'.
	
	3c. In the constructor, under 	'super(x, y, width, height);', fill in the following:
		* code = ??; 		where ?? is the next int available in the 
			"	else if (shapeCode == 19)
					temp = new Sky(0, 0, 0, 0);
				else if (shapeCode == 20)
					temp = new Skyline(0, 0, 0, 0);
				else if (shapeCode == 21)
					temp = new Text(0, 0, 0, 0);
				else if (shapeCode == 22)
					temp = new Wall(0, 0, 0, 0);
				else if (shapeCode == 23)
					temp = new Wheel(0, 0, 0, 0);	" block from entities.Shape.
		* name = "xxxx"; 	where xxxx is the exact name of the class.
		* defaultWidth = ??;	where ?? is the default width for this shape in the editor
		* defaultHeight = ??;	where ?? is the default height for this shape in the editor
		* solid = true;		iff the player is able to land on the object (ie non-scenery pieces)
	
	3d. If the object is solid, then when the player lands on it the object will interact() with the player.
		* Fill in this method with the desired action, or ask me to.
		* Leaving this blank is just fine, although it's preferred to say "// do nothing" so it's intentional.
	
	3e.
