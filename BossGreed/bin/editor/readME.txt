ReadME for the Editor:

Right now it's not feature-rich at all. What you can do is use the mouse to click and place objects
(by default the left-facing bag), translate the internal screen without messing up the outside frame (WASD),
save (control-S), load (control-O), and switch to the arrow (hit X).

Basically just a prototype, but I had a nice flash of insight about how to move on and I'm very excited to
get home tonight and implement it. I'm going to really flesh out the assignPic method, which together with the
abstract pic methods in Shape (only one file- not in any of the rest), can very very powerfully make things happen.

I'm excited. I think progress is going to happen quickly.
