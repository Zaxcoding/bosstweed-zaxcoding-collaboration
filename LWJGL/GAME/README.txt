CONTROLS:
left arrow-left
right arrow-right
up arrow-jump
spacebar-run

***down arrow-move screen up
***right shift-move screen down


***- there are some 'camera' changes and i have tested and they seem ok, but if it gets
out of control use these controls to fix it.

RULES: don't touch the red.


There is a long drop right in the beginning of the game(15 or so seconds) and i am planning on using this drop to give the controls of the game, or say something on the back of the walls but as of now text sucks in opengl so its just a long drop thats kind of annoying.

The end of the game should be pretty obvious as you will find a purple door and then you should see a giant END.

There is only one 'level' if you will as there are no menu screens or anything, and so dying cuts out the program, because of this you have to start over every time you die.

There are more ideas i think i could do with this game, but I just want to see how it is, and to see if you think its worth it to do another level, or to just start a different type of game.
