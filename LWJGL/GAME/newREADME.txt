somewhat of a completely new game


no spacebar to run! just arrow keys.

don't touch the red

once you touch the 'ice' you cannot change directions until you land on a non ice piece.

must restart game to play again.

if you are inside the purple door, you win. no separate win screen yet.

let me know how it is.
