Texturedemo.java - just creates a big black screen with a tiny tiny wood jpg as a texture square, the wood.jpg was the image file used.

helloworld.java - this one is cooler, you can drag the squares around with left click and let go with right click and the color changes with left click

for these to work you need the lwjgl set up, I don't know how to do it any other way than by following the youtube videos that i did so i definitely suggest that! follow the link, it will take about a half hour to get everything up and running to a point where you are comfortable, maybe even shorter. many many future commits for this as there are 29 videos and i am only through 5. episode 9 is pong!!! so pumped for that.
