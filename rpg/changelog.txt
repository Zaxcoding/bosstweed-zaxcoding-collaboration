	Zach - 6/13/12

	Added brainstorm.txt, just a bunch of thinking out loud.
	
	Downloaded Pixen, a pixel art editor, and tried to make a grass tile, based on a tutorial: petesqbsite.com/sections/tutorials/tuts/tsugumo/
	This shit is going to be ridiculously tough.

	I'm going to shower and then come back and brainstorm some more.
