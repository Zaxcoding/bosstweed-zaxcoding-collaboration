This is a sweet idea, just a trial run to make sure i can edit this and push back to the repo successfully. I don't think my previous Facebook post from my phone went through. I have also slowed on coding since we last spoke, the obj-c books seemed somewhat dated, or xCode just had an update, either way it was a weird format, i still got it working but it seemed like xCode wanted everything in header files and it was just awkward. Do we have a language for Project Euler stuff? Or just whatever we want to do?

I figure instead of individually uploading a bunch of different messages to each other, we can just use one (like this) as a message board of sorts. I guess we could have others like a changelog or buglist once we're really collaborating. Also, lets push the older messages down and write the newer ones on top.

Just an idea:
When we're into development of an app or heavy coding project, instead of dumping all the debug/tracing info to the console, write it to a file "debug.log" or something of the sort. Much easier to work with a text file than the console.

great find, started looking at it and almost had the itch to start coding along right away, pretty awesome when pitt professors actually write the books but unfortunately we don't have him. I like this site, trying to get more and more used to it. So is there a general plan yet of what is going on? C for 449 C++ for 1566 or Objective-C for apps? or even more intensive java stuff?
