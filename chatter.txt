I figure instead of individually uploading a bunch of different messages to each other, we can just use one (like this) as a message board of sorts. I guess we could have others like a changelog or buglist once we're really collaborating. Also, lets push the older messages down and write the newer ones on top.

Just an idea:
When we're into development of an app or heavy coding project, instead of dumping all the debug/tracing info to the console, write it to a file "debug.log" or something of the sort. Much easier to work with a text file than the console.

great find, started looking at it and almost had the itch to start coding along right away, pretty awesome when pitt professors actually write the books but unfortunately we don't have him. I like this site, trying to get more and more used to it. So is there a general plan yet of what is going on? C for 449 C++ for 1566 or Objective-C for apps? or even more intensive java stuff?
